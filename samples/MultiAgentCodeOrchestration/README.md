# Sample: Multi-Agent Code Task Orchestration

This sample demonstrates how to orchestrate multi-agent task execution using a conversation thread-based communication
between 2 agents for code programming and inspection and task planner agent working with user to create a plan
for the required SW coding tasks.

## Prerequisites

Please see the [Prerequisities] for details.

## Configure the sample

Sample consists of following agents and their roles:
- TaskPlannerAgent
  - Creates plan (tasks) using users input and knowledge about CodeProgrammerAgent and CodeInspectionAgent assistant instances to achieve the required SW engineering work.
  - Uses own conversation thread with user
- CodeProgrammerAgent
  - Configured to handle SW programming related tasks
  - Uses functions to access files for reading and writing
  - Uses shared conversation thread with CodeInspectionAgent
- CodeInspectionAgent
  - Configured to handle SW inspection related tasks
  - Uses functions to access files for reading
  - Uses shared conversation thread with CodeProgrammerAgent

### Configure the Agents

TaskPlannerAgent get the details about CodeProgrammerAgent and CodeInspectionAgent by file references in the yaml configuration.
NOTE: Check the file references paths are configured correctly for your environment, the file_references field in yaml config files 
require absolute path.

## Run the sample

```sh
python main.py
```
